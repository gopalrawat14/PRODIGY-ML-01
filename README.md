House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This repository contains an implementation of a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle:

House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques Dataset
Overview

Predicting house prices is a classic problem in machine learning and regression analysis. In this project, we utilize linear regression to estimate house prices using key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.

Implementation Details

Dependencies
To run the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Usage
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
Download the Dataset:

Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link and place it in the data/ directory.

Run the Code:

Execute the Python script house_price_prediction.py to train the linear regression model and predict house prices.

bash
Copy code
python house_price_prediction.py
Interpret Results:

After running the script, the model's predictions and evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, R-squared) will be displayed or saved as visualizations.

Results

The linear regression model provides estimates of house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The accuracy of predictions can be evaluated using statistical metrics and visualizations included in the output.
